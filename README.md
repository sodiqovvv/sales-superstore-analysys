# SuperStore Data Analysis Project

In this project, after some basic cleaning methods I worked on 4 big analsys that 
companies actually care about: most sold product, most profitable segment, 
sale trends in each year, and which sub-categories are profitable.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains information about sales information, such as:

* Quantity
* Order ID
* Order Date
* Ship Date
* City
* Sub-Category
* Profit
* Segment

## 🧹 Data Cleaning

* First, I converted the dates to datetime to be able to use them for analsys.
* I used strip method to remove spaces around the names in category column to avoid duplicates.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis

I observed 4 things in the dataset that companies actually need to know about.

### 1. Top 5 most sold products

### 2. Which segments were most profitable

### 3. Sale trends in each year

### 4. Which sub-categories were leading to profit and which were not.

## ✅ Tools Used

* Python 🐍
* pandas 📊
* matplotlib and seaborn 📈

## 📌 Conclusion

This porject taught me the things that companies want me to analyze. 
In the future I am going to use these techniques for observations and give insights.
